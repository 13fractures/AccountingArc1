<p class="test3">I am Ilaiza, and I was a STEM student before I enter college as a freshman. When I was a senior high school student, I was always thinking about where the path I will carry in the future. I don't like business totally because I want to be an engineer student someday but God has a better plan for me. He did not give me the opportunity to be an engineer. But on the other hand, he puts me to the opportunity to be an accountant student. I don't have any insights in this course but I am hardly trying to love and accept this forever.</p>
<p class="test3">My future plans is to be a Certified Management Accountant and travel abroad. I want to work outside of my country. And also I want to make a business by my own. This business is a cafe which is a business that will be beneficial for students and workers or employees. If there is a man that is destined to be mine "Edi go, tanggap agad". But in fact, I want to focus on myself for now and continue  reaching my goals in life. It was hard to be in a relationship nowadays, it was like an accounting. You can't be assured if you can't see the fact.</p>
<p class="test3">If you want to achieve something in life just be go with the flow and trust the process. God has always a great plan for us. I know that all of us will be successful someday. And I hope that if you reach your goals do not forget to thank all the people helps you. "Ganbatte ne! Mina-San".</p>

      <p> Future Dream Job: Psychiatrist, Accountant, Chef</p>
      <hr>
<p class="test3">Hi, I’m Pauleen Jeri Maniego, a graduate from STEM.</p>
<p class="test3">Back when I was in Junior High School, I was not really a fan of anything related to Mathematics and Science, in other words, it’s not my forte. I struggled a lot in these subjects but I managed to pass my Junior Year. When I was in Grade 9, I started to become more passionate on what I’m doing. I started to think of what I really want to do in the future. When I was a kid, my dream is to be a Flight Attendant together with my cousins but while I’m growing, I realized that it’s not for me so I tried to think of what I want in the past years. A lot of professions came into my mind but this one course really caught my attention, Bachelor of Science in Psychology. My interest in Psychology started when I was in Grade 10 and in Grade 10, it was also the time for us to choose a strand for college. I was really having a deep thought on what strand should I take since the STEM strand is not my forte and the other two strands are not aligned with my desired course but one reason made me choose STEM. I heard somewhere that STEM is the most preferred strand and that it is more advanced. I really thought that I wouldn’t survive in STEM and I would’ve just shift strand but luckily, I didn’t. It wasn’t that bad and I graduated as a STEM student with Honors.</p>
<p class="test3">After I graduated my Senior Year, I applied in multiple universities. My desired course is still BS Psychology but I also have my other desired course aside from it. I also applied for scholarship hoping that I could pass. I waited for months for confirmations in the universities I want but sadly, I wasn’t qualified to some of them. I was really losing hope since I’m worried that I don’t have any school to attend to so I tried to take an exam in a school here in our city and fortunately, I passed but I didn’t get to have my first choice. I enrolled in Bachelor of Science in Management Accounting, which is my second choice but right after I enrolled, I received an e-mail to the school I reconsidered saying that I also passed with my desired course. I was really dejected when I received that e-mail. It was one of the universities I wanted and it’s just too heavy in my heart to reject it but I have left with no choice. I continued studying Accounting knowing that it is not aligned with my strand and I was really clueless with some of the subjects since I didn’t graduate from ABM but I guess it’s part of our life, sometimes we need to learn other things that we don’t know. So far, despite of not having my desired course, I still enjoyed studying my course now. </p>
<p class="test3">In the future, I’m planning to pursue what my heart really wants. I’ll study again but this time with my desired course. I will achieve what I planned in life: to spoil my whole family with all the richest I can give (because they so much deserve it), to have a family, better social status, to travel the world, and lastly, to get a degree and a title. I WANT TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PERSON THAT MY FAMILY CAN BE PROUD OF.</p>
<p class="test3">While I’m writing this story, I realized that even if we really want something, if it’s not for us, then it’s not for us. Sometimes, we need to be in a different path in order to discover what is really for us. On the other hand, we have all the time to start again, if we really want to, we can. A lot of overthinking may come, but don't let it overcome you. I was once an overthinker and I encountered a lot of uncertainty and confusions with my journey but look, I managed to overcome them all. Just focus on your goals, be persistent, and look forward. No matter how many obstacles come in our way, at the end of the day, we will certainly find our own happiness and dream. PADAYON!</p>

      <p> Future Dream Job: Accountant, Engineer, Lawyer</p>
      <hr>
<p class="test3">Hi! I am Julius Ryle. When I was in my senior high school years, I chose the strand Accountancy and Business Management before entering college. Before as a child and as a junior high school student, I set my eyes in the course of being an engineer. But after encountering the bookkeeping subject in my grade 9, it opened up my mind that what I want is to be a Certified Public Accountant or CPA in the future. I totally liked math before in my early high school years but as the time progressed I got tired and math has been hard for me and that's why I got into businesses and finances. Up until now, I am currently and willingly pursuing my education and dream as a Management Accounting student for the City College of San Jose Del Monte. </p>
<p class="test3">My future plan is to be a Certified Public Accountant as I stated before and make funds or money to have a stable future ahead of me. For the future, I am dreaming of working as an accountant for businesses in other countries. The reason of me wanting money or funds is because I want to provide the life that I want for my family now where they can have what they want and also for my self while traveling to see the beauty of this world. I also set my self to having my own family in the future with my girlfriend (ihh), a family where it's free and fun but also secure. But I do not think of having a family quickly because I want to pursue my career whether I have a family or not. </p>
<p class="test3">That's it for me. I'll just end this with letting everyone know that if you set on your eyes to something, you definitely can get it but if you can't then there will surely be an alternative. I hope that each and everyone of us will have a good future ahead with the dreams that we want. This may be unrelated but I hope everyone spends their times with others or their loved ones as if it's your last time being with them ^^.</p>

      <p> Future Dream Job: Nurse, Pharmacist, Chef</p>
      <hr>
    <p class="test3">Before entering high school, I already knew what profession I wanted to pursue. It is my dream to be part of the medical field, and my second choice was in the hospitality industry, but how did I end up taking a Bachelor of Science in Management Accounting? It has been 3 years, but I still remember how I decided what path I would take in senior high school. The school where I studied only offers three strands, which are Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). If I wanted to study a medical field course, it would be wise to just choose STEM. At that time, I knew that most of the medical courses would cost a huge amount of money, which we could not afford. Therefore, I had to choose between practicality and my dream course. I hate public speaking, so HUMSS is excluded from my choices. I was contemplating between ABM and STEM but chose ABM in the end. What helped me decide was the thought that if I ever take STEM, I'll still not be able to take any related courses because of financial strain. </p>
    <p class="test3">Taking ABM is a wise and practical choice because the business industry is flexible, and it is somehow aligned with my second choice. Unfortunately, I also did not get a chance to study a course under the hospitality industry, which led me to the City College of San Jose Del Monte. Upon passing, I actually do not have a plan to take an accounting course because I find it difficult. I am interested, but I know deep inside that I am not enthusiastic about it. However, I still wanted to align my course with my strand, so I courageously took Bachelor of Science in Management Accounting.</p>
    <p class="test3">While gradually adjusting to a new environment, I have realized that there is a huge difference between high school and college, and as expected, I am already having a hard time with schoolwork. At first, I was considering aiming for Latin honors but immediately dismissed the thought because I did not want to disappoint and put pressure on myself. As much as possible, I want to prioritize my well-being but still make sure there is learning progress while I am in college. I am also having some thoughts about what I want for my future now that I am almost in adulthood. If I am able to finish this course, there is a possibility that I will take a bridging program for a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. Followed by preparation for taking the Certified Management Accountant and Certified Public Accountant licensure examinations. It is also fine with me if I am not able to continue in the bridging program because I can still take the CMA licensure exam. By the time I have a sufficient budget, I want to establish my own business as well. So that my learning won't go to waste and can be used for the long run.</p>
    <p class="test3">Aside from thinking all about work, I want to celebrate my achievements and reward myself by traveling to different countries and finding a handsome foreigner I can be with in life. Kidding aside, I do not think that I will focus on my love life and will just go with the flow because I want to enjoy my life in the future as much as I can by doing the things I am not able to do right now.</p>
    <p class="test3">Not having a chance to attain my dream course and profession saddens me, but being upset and bitter about it cannot change anything. There is nothing else I can do but accept where I am right now. Even though these dreams have been buried, I still have goals for myself that I think I should and really want to fulfill. There are some days when I feel extremely unmotivated to do things, but these goals of mine are what keep me moving forward. Similar to the lyrics from the song of my favorite boy group, "Over and over again, I'll overcome what's right in front of me. Let's turn tears into hope over and over again, to go forward towards a colorful everyday", I believe that accepting things that are not meant for me and overcoming every challenge in front of me will help me grow and be successful.</p>

      <hr>
<p class="test3">I was pretty set on pursuing a career in Accounting, Business, and Management before I even started Senior High School. Despite getting terrible grades in grade 11 and being a modular student, I didn't consider switching strands at that time. I've already moved on lmao. I am Grade 12 already face-to-face classes started earlier than I expected. Naturally, I was apprehensive at first, but I eventually got used to it. My dream is to become a flight attendant, which I truly want to do. I want to own a business as well, at the same time.</p>
<p class="test3">I gave the course I would take some serious thought before I graduated from the ABM strand. I decided right then and there that I would not enroll in the tourism course since I desired to be practical and I was aware of our fragile financial situation. My future plans call for extensive travel, a home of my own, and financial independence in order to compensate for my parents' struggles and indulge them as much as possible. It seems like all I want is a sugar daddy (joke).  I want a child, but I don't want to give birth. Therefore, adoption might be the best alternative.</p>
<p class="test3">Trust that the future can still be beautiful even if it looks different than what you were expecting. Trust that even here, more is unfolding beyond what you have been able to see. Even when things have changed. You may not be able to be everything to everyone, but you can still be everything you were meant to be by choosing to be present and ready to grow at every place on the journey. I hope you remember that when times were hard, you found courage to not give up.</p>

      <p> Future Dream Job: Electric Engineer, Civil Engineer </p>
      <hr>
<p class="test3">Being an accounting student wasn't really my plan. I tried to avoid anything related to business because I don't like interacting with people, I don't want to be an entrepreneur that's why I took STEM and convinced myself that I will be a future doctor someday. I was inspired to be a doctor because I find diseases fascinating and I wanted to study and find a cure about it. However, that changed when we learned about statistics and probability, I suddenly wanted to be an electrical engineer and finish what my father started. This desire grew even more because I found out I wasn't good at chemistry in which was one of the factors that the doctor needs to have. When it's already time to take entrance exams and applications, I always make electrical engineering as my first choice, however City College of San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan doesn't have this course and that's why I took accounting so that I couldn't miss the opportunity.</p>
<p class="test3">At the time, I was just hoping to find better results since I was rejected to all of the schools that I took electrical engineering, and here I am now, the path that I was avoiding so much is here right in front of me. It's not that I hate this path, I just don't want to be in this industry because I believe I lack the skills and abilities that should be needed here. Additionally, I wanted to be the first engineer on my father's side since my Dad didn't get to finish his studies that's why I wanted to pursue that career path for him. Besides, I enjoy anything electrical, I'm amazed and wanted to try things out with it but I made a sudden turn and followed my Mom's path. </p>
<p class="test3">Right now my future plan is to take electrical engineering after I finish this course, if time will still be given to me, I'll make myself have the titles CMA, CPA and Engr. I know it wasn't alignned that much but when i die, I wanted this titles engraved to my stone with the caption of "Died happily achieving both of her parents dreams" I bet that will look cool and I want to look cool even if I'm already buried six feet below. I don't really want to have children ever, I don't want to bear a child of my own, if ever I'll have a kid that will most likely come from an orphanage, but nonetheless I will still love them as if they came from me. I wanted to have a cat in the future too that is as calm and chaotic as me because I do not like anything that disturbs my peace and destroys my happiness, I think owning a cat can keep me accompany with my lonely life (charot HAHAHAHA). Anyways, that's all for my future plans I guess, I will be a successful rich sister and auntie and I will spoil my younger cousins and their soon to be children! </p>
<p class="test3">My experience right now is just starting but I want everyone to know that it is never too late to dream and achieve your original plans, it's okay to take a sudden drift with your career in life. As long as you're happy and breathing, make impossible things possible because that can make you happy and even recognized by people who think lowly of you. It is better to give revenge this way rather than doing it in an awful way. Nonetheless always choose what will make you happy and always love yourself so that you can achieve a proper self care for you and your love ones. While on the journey, don't forget to appreciate people whether they may be around you or not, always thank them for making you what you are now. I am still young and strong I know somewhere in this universe, my intermundia will be my home again.

<p class="test3">Hi, I am Julian, and ICT was my strand when I was a senior high school student. I chose ICT because that was the only strand that I liked a little bit in my former school, they also offer ABM but i didn't choose it because I don't like business. I want to be a STEM student in another school, but my mom didn't want to transfer me to another school since we were only a few steps away from my former school, so I had no choice because of the pandemic and for my safety purposes. My SHS experience is not that fun because I don't like my strand, and our school is only focused on modules, so I didn't enjoy my SHS time. I took a year break from college to study automotive at TESDA and I worked for my uncle in an auto repair shop as a helper mechanic for 3 months to gain experience, which I will use in the future.</p>
<p class="test3">My future plan is to finish my bachelor's degree here and move to my parents in Australia to continue to study for my future career. And also, I want to start my own businesses like a gym, an auto repair shop, and a laundry shop. And I am dreaming of working with my dad on the mine site as an auto electrician. I also want to have my own family in the future, but I want to pursue my future career first.</p>
<p class="test3">That's it. I'll just suggest that you have fun, don't put too much pressure on yourself, choose what you want carefully, and tell your parents about your goals. I hope you succeed in all of your life's goals.</p>

      <hr>
<p class="test3">Science was never my forte and I'm not comfortable speaking in front of people. Math is the only subject that I was interested in during high school the main reason why I chose the ABM strand. I thought it was the easiest strand of senior high school. But the 2nd semester came and the subject Fundamentals of Accounting, Business, and Management was introduced to us. That was when I found out that ABM is not a math focused strand, but hell focused- scratch that. It was more on analyzing, which later on I found out that I suck on it. I considered taking other strands in 12th grade, But the teachers said that I have to take all the specialized subject of the strand. I wanted my life to be more chill, so my final decision was to just continue suffering in ABM. </p>
<p class="test3">The 12th grade came and it was conducted in face-to-face classes, which made my senior high school life more memorable. Now that I think about it, I have a lot of stressful moments since we have 2 theses in the first sem. Thank God that my groupmates were great, unlike in 11th grade where there is only the two of us who are doing the tasks and a dumbell member did not even pay me for the expenses in printing and soft bound. What a bad memory, right? Which is why I'm thankful that I got great groupmates in 12th grade. The time went by fast and it was time for our graduation. I actually graduated with high honors which shocked me a lot, because I remember that most of the time I was sleeping, eating, and laughing with my friends.</p>
<p class="test3">For college, I only applied for state universities and those with free to low amount of tuitions. Because I don't want to burden my parents with payments. I was really nervous when I heard that CCSJDM was releasing their results and I was not confident because I just guessed most of my answers. Fortunately, I passed and I enrolled at the same time with a friend because I can never open a conversation with new people. Later on, I found out that I passed in my dream university which made me want to back out in CCSJDM, but the courses available are not what I prefer. So instead of backing out, I continued to study in CCSJDM. Now that I'm currently a 1st year BSMA student, I realized that life is full of obstacles and even now I am still feeling lost. It has been 1 month since the school year started and I'm already considering to just say hello to concentrix or just get a sugar daddy.</p>
<p class="test3">My future plans is to hopefully graduate a bachelor's degree. Then work for a few years as a Certified Management Accountant, It is recognized globally so if an opportunity overseas appears to me, I am definitely going to grab it. It has been my dream to travel different countries and to bid farewell in the Philippines (ehe). After a few years of work experience, I am planning to take a Juris Doctor course. Because ever since I was a kid, I have always dreamed of becoming a public service lawyer. Future plans for lovelife? I have none, If a person comes then I am willing to take the risk. But if there is none, then I'm fine with being single forever. I have my family and friends to make me experience the feeling of being loved and for me that is more than enough.</p>
<p class="test3">Through my experience, I want to tell people that 'During your first time it is okay to feel lost.' It is hard to adjust to one's new experience. It may take weeks, months, or even a year and that is fine. Our life is full of challenges, there are times where we succeed and times where we fail. But people should always remeber that failure is not a result, but a part of process to succeed. What's important in the journey that we have experienced is to learn through the process.</p>

      <hr>
<p class="test3">Hello, I am Nimrad Allison Mercado, a former ABM student. I graduated from Graceville National High School, and when I was in Grade 11, I studied at Village Montessori School and Colleges. Due to the illness of my grandmother, I took a three years break from studying. After I finish junior high school, I really don't know what strand I'll be taking. In the end I chose ABM, not so related to my dream job but I have no choice but to be practical. During my Senior High School life, I realized that I do have a potential to this program. I analyzed quickly, good in balancing, and I'm enjoying this kind of work. So I take the risk and took entrance exam at City College of San Jose. I dont have any other choice of school, If I failed to pass it then I dont have the choice but to start working. But in God's will, I passed it and my dreams are finally starting as Management Accounting Student.</p>
<p class="test3">My future plan is to be a Doctor. But to achieve it, my first plan is to be a Certified Public Accountant and work abroad. Make a lot of savings and pursue my dream job by studying again. I want to be successful because I am sick of being poor. I need to fight for my dreams and live to the fullest. Ofcourse, everybody wants to have a family and I am not an exception. I do imagining my self playing my kids in the garden, making their snacks for school, fixing the necktie of my husband, and me being as the "ilaw ng tahanan". And in right time, all of this will be worth praying for. </p>
<p class="test3">To everyone who is doubting themselves, If you think you are too old in pursuing your dreams, always remember that their is no race in life. If it is your time, you will be shine. Do not pressure your self and just enjoy what you have and achieve what you want.</p>
